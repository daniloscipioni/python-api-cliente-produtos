# Visão Geral do Projeto

This project is built using FastAPI, a modern and fast Python web framework for building APIs. It leverages a PostgreSQL database to manage data, which is run in a Docker container for convenience and isolation.


The purpose of this project is to provide a robust API backend with efficient database management, making it suitable for scalable and high-performance applications.



Features


FastAPI-based API backend

PostgreSQL database integration

Docker containerization for the database

Easy setup and deployment



Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:



Python 3.8+

Docker (and Docker Compose)

pip (Python package manager)



Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:


1. Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

2. Install Python Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:


bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project to store environment variables:


plaintext
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname

Replace user, password, and dbname with your desired PostgreSQL credentials.


4. Set Up Docker Container for PostgreSQL

Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory:


yaml
Copy code
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres_container
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: dbname
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:

Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL container:


bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d


Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI Server

Run the FastAPI application using the following command:


bash
Copy code
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000.


2. Access the Interactive API Docs

Once the server is running, you can explore the interactive API documentation at:



Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

Deployment

To deploy the application, ensure Docker is set up on your server and follow these steps:




Start the PostgreSQL container:


bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d



Build and run the FastAPI application container:


bash
Copy code
docker build -t fastapi-app .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env fastapi-app




Troubleshooting


Database Connection Issues: Ensure the PostgreSQL container is running and the credentials in .env match the configuration in docker-compose.yml.

Port Conflicts: Make sure ports 5432 (PostgreSQL) and 8000 (FastAPI) are not being used by other applications.
